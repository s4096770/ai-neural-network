# 🧠 AI Neural Network Visualiser

This project builds a **neural network from scratch** to model the XOR problem, demonstrating how learning occurs through **forward propagation, backpropagation**, and **gradient descent** — all implemented from first principles in Python.

It includes both:
- 📗 A **Jupyter Notebook** explaining the underlying mathematics step by step  
- ⚙️ A **Streamlit App** to interactively visualise the network’s learning process
